Problem Statement /Definition:-
Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of Second,
third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly, one may cancel the
membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary
of club.

c) Display members
d) Display list in reverse order using recursion
e) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists
