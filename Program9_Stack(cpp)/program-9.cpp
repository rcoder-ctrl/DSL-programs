/*A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically, punctuation,
capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is a palindrome, as can
be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and observing that they are the same
forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and
then compare with them the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program*/
